/**
 * This class defines a data object representing the range values associated
 * with a particular domain value, called a boundary value. The domain value is
 * not stored here, since objects of this class are intended to be used as the
 * values in a map where the domain value is the key.
 * 
 * Three values must be specified for each boundary value. The lesserValue field
 * is used for interpolation upon smaller domain values; the greaterValue field
 * is used for interpolation upon larger domain values; and the equalValue field
 * is used when the domain value is exactly equal to the associated boundary
 * domain value. This distinction is needed to support different ranges of
 * interpolation above and below the same domain value, plus allow a distinctly
 * different value for exact matches.

 *  V - Calculated visual object (Color, etc.)
